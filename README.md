This was supposed to be my master's thesis when I was enrolled in my master program AIDC (Artificial Intelligence and Distributed Computing).

I have used the GNUPLOT library for plotting purposes, currently this project is a passion project to create some chaotic maps and trying to prevent the chaos using an AI.

It does work, sometimes and currently in this setup will work 100%, if you do intend to use it, have at it 😁
